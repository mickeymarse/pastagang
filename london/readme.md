I'm trying to make this page future proof by only including central listings of events, rather than individual events, as that would become out of date very soon.

If you're organising events in the London coding scene, I'd highly recommend having a central listing of your events somewhere to make our community more accessible to outsiders, even if that means having a single static page that you update. Bonus points if you can give out updates to people, so they don't have to keep manually checking. 

Thank you!
