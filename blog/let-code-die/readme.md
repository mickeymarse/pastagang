## why let code die
- Let code die to have less emotional attachment to code
- and to write more code and then it gets easier
- also to create more room for new different code including all kinds of fun errors.

And
- Let performances die by not recording them.
- Let music die by not recording it.
- Then record anyway to share with people (which kills the music)

## Moving on

If you are grieving or otherwise sensitive to mortality, you can thing of this concept as 'let it float down the river'. Be an observer, take an interest, but don't form unhealthy attachments where they aren't necessary. You can work on this by forming/strengthening healthy attachments with humans using careful trust, self-care and strong boundaries.

# but wait, you're overthinking this

The pastagang paradox:\
Temporary code will live permanently. Code you want to live long and prosper will die young.

everything produced is a product of everything that preceded it, whether it's still around or not

<br>

well, your code will die anyway at some point. plus exercise is good, repetition is good. repetition is also good and bear in mind that repetition is good too. In moderation. and unmoderation.
