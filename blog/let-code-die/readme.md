let's write a blog post.

i sometimes find that it's helpful to write a throwaway blog post when trying to write something [bigger](https://github.com/pastagang/pastagang/edit/main/paper/readme.md)

# Let code die 

the origins of "let code die" lie in [robust first computing](https://andrewwalpole.com/blog/an-introduction-to-robust-first-computation/) and [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/permacomputing/) and [local first computing](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/). all three movements acknowledge that code can break and die in various ways, and that we should plan around that

why do we try to maintain projects that are old and should be deprecated? most such projects have newer alternatives that are more secure, more functional, and better suited for the modern world, yet we keep using things like email, pgp, x11, etc etc

Let code die to have less emotional attachment to code and to write more code and then it gets easier. Also to create more room for new different code including all kinds of fun errors.

And
Let performances die by not recording them. Let music die by not recording it.
Then record anyway to share with people (which kills the music)
