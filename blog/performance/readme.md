# "performance" in pasta gang

no I'm not talking about "performing"

I'm talking about "performance" as in... how fast things run on your laptop or phone.

<br>

<hr>

<br>

when jamming in tools like [nudel](https://nudel.cc) and [flok](https://flok.cc), the programs running can get pretty intense and it can start to run slow on your machine. 

this can be sad because it might mean you can't join in with the jam as fully as other people, or even worse... maybe not at all

as a jamming group, it's our duty to make the jam "performant" enough so that every single person can access it. for me it's crucial. in fact, it makes me quite cross sometimes because we are leaving so many people behind. 

it can be easy for us all (me too) to get "excited" about brand new flashy "ideas" that seem cool but only make "performance" worse (both kinds)

<br>

at meetups, i see new joiners struggle to get things to run well on their laptop, and their phone, and i say sorry time and time again. 

it's not good enough! we need to stop saying we'll do something and do something. we need to make the jam open to all.

this blog post is an attempt to wake people up about this, on behalf of all those who we exclude

## what do we do 

(tick when done and/or add new items to the list)

- [ ] write a guide on getting nudel and flok to work well on slower machines
- [ ] write a guide on best practice around writing "performant" jam code. like "clip(1)" and so on...
- [ ] port all "performance" settings from flok to nudel
- [ ] make a new flok client that aims for "performance" above all else. 
- [ ] add a clear "performance" settings section to nudel with helpful defaults and presets to pick from
- [ ] add "performance" tracking to nudel that gives warnings when it gets bad
- [ ] add the ability to reload strudel and/or hydra within nudel without needing to reload the entire page
- [ ] add more "performance" settings such as turning off jammer's cursors, and changing frame rate. 
- [ ] measure and audit and write up what's slowing things down right now
- [x] write a blog post to convince people to care about this
