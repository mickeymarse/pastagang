# in person pastagang performance

on the 9th april, pastagang will have a long slot at the London algorave.

the only "problem" is that no one is in charge of pastagang so there's no one to decide what to do or who should be there or anything

over the last few days i've been mulling this over... i think there are load of different approaches we could take here. i want to find a balance between:

- keeping the spirit of the jam. keeping it collaborative.
- avoiding complete unpleasant chaos.
- reckter: Probably have a more beafy PC for audio. Maybe even a dedicated one that has only audio enabled for the room. (but ofc needs organization)

i'll try to list out some more ideas later but... it could be anything like these

- three to four laptops at the front. four people start up there, but invite others to come and "have a turn" at times. get vocal samples from randomers.
- connected to the internet? or local server only? internet is fun. but also... i think its good for the performers and the crowd to share the same space/room.
- mad idea: put the laptops in the middle of the room in-the-round and hope no one spills beer on them.
   - reckter: This seems more pastagangy then having 4 in front, it's all about participation right?
- set up chairs and things in different places in the room (or venue) and let any visitor connect and jam. but this could get very chaotic right? jamming with large numbers is quite hard. but maybe thats okay.
- i feel like someone should give a little intro at the start. like "this is pastagang. anyone can join. there is no pasting or undo. advice: make room for someone else. if something needs doing, do it. if something doesnt need doing, dont do it. if something sounds good, let it shine. if something sounds bad let it die."
- some occasional moments of silence could help to reset the madness. pause for silence. record some samples. and repeat - starting from scratch
- QR code on screen for people to join with phone? hmm nah
- mad idea: implement a way of letting people stream their cameras into the visuals. then lots of people at the venue could whip out phones or laptop cameras, and let the internet-connected people feel more present in the jam. this also centers the jam on the crowd, not the performers. as hopefullly.. there would be lots of footage of the crowd etc. i dunno
   - reckter: I LOVE this idea.
